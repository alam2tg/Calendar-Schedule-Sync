After logging in, I am presented with home page with a start button and a tutorial button

As a user, when I click the start button the blackjack page is rendered

//tutorial page

//blackjack page
    //mid gameplay functionality
    When the blackjack page is opened, I can press the "deal" button to get a fresh hand
    when the deal button is clicked, the game begins and the cards are dealt in this order:

    1. Deal one card to players face up
    2. Deal one card to Dealer facedown

    3. then deal another card to user faceup
    4. then, deal another card to dealer face up

    As a user, when I press the stand button, I "end my hand"
    As a user, when I press the hit button, I am dealt another card, and that is added to my hand value
    As a user, I want the choice to hit or stand, if my hand value is 21

    As a user, when I "end my hand", the dealer displays their facedown card.
    As a user, I want the dealer to be dealt another card if their hand value is under 17
    As a user, I want the "hand to end" when the dealer has a hand value of 17-21 or busts 
    As a user, I want the player and dealer hands to be compared when the hand ends to determine if I win, lose, or draw
    // win lose draw logic
        As a user, if the player has a higher hand value than the dealer, it's a win
        s a user, if the player has a lower hand value than the dealer, it's a lose
        As a user, if the player and dealer have the same hand value, then it's a draw

    As a user, if the dealer hand value is over 21, then they "Bust" and player wins the hand

    As a user, when I win a hand, the count of the win score goes up by 1
    As a user, when I lose a hand, the count of the lose score goes up by 1

    As a user, when I see a faceup card with a value of 2-6, the count goes up by 1
    As a user, when I see a faceup card with a value of 7-9, the count stays the same, no increment
    As a user, when I see a faceup card with a value of 10 or higher, the count goes down by 1
    As a user, I want the 10, J, Q, K, and A to have a value of 10 or higher
    //ace logic
        As a user, when an ace is drawn, I want to choose if the value is 1 or 11
